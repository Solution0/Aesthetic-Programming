# Isaac
This is my 2nd mini exercise in the course aesthetic programming.
This time we had the focus on the fun in programming, both in the experience of programming and the program itself.

Because of this I wanted to make something that i personally find very fun, but most people would 'bat' an eye at.
The indie game: *Binding of Isaac*.

## Weird fun
The game introduces a crazy religious story of a hearthbroken child getting chased by his mother who wants to sacrifice him in the name of God. (A reference to the christian story of Isaac from Genesis)
The game is best described as a cartoon nightmare filled with religous and obscene characters and scenery. While some people is triggered and disgusted, others see the beauty in the indepth rogue-like gameplay and imaginative drawings. The game is also filled with popculture references that go deep into things as: memes, movies, series, famous people and other games. For me this is fun, not just well planned jokes but also references, wordplay and challenges. A kind of 'geeky' fun. 

## Approach
This time around I wanted to make the foundation for something bigger. The project is a game which require a lot of interactivity and some aspect of variables in gameplay. I have some experience in this kind of game development. I have been a game tester on Inside(Playdead), Trailmakers(Flashbulb games) and Project Knoxville(Press Play) as well as both ingaged in and supervised gamedevelopment on a camp for three years.

As this was not an original game, but a replica of another, I wanted to focus on others things important for this kind of game developemnt. In the code it meant that **descriptions** and **structure** was a necessity. Recesses and folding gave me the structure, space and overview that i needed. Having the ability to hide descriptions and valid code boosted the efficiency and made for less scrolling and more code on the screen at the same time. 

**variables** was also a really big thing this time around. To make everything more adaptable it was important to use less and less raw numbers and more variables that could be easily defined. This made everything dependent on some few variables making it easy to change values and finetune. 

Outside the coding itself It also meant some structure in the development of the .js file itself. Having a clear overview of milestones and changes through each **commit to GitHub**. This meant that I was to save often and make milestones underway that marked steps that was finetuned and free of bugs and errors. These i could name Isaac 1.0, Isaac 1.1 and so on.

## Challenges
In my attempt to recreate the game in p5.js code i encountered many challenges, some I overcomed while others I saved for later exercises. This include:
- Projectiles
- Random pictures assets
- Multiple levels
- Animation

These additions will be the focus in my mini exercise #3.
