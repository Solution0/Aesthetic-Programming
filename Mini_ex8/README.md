The program is called, “Did you get the memo?” It is about finding the trending memes from giphy.com since you want to be up on the beat. The internet culture of memes move so fast that you always need to be updated to the latest and greatest. 
Gifs has become some sort of computer language since the APIs has become available to the biggest chat forums. You no longer have to write a message you can just type in your feelings and find a gif that expresses what you want. At the same time people get to reference popular tv-shows, movies or even memes.

A gif is also a great way to show humour, and that you are up on the beat. And by being up on the beat you can become a trendsetter and ultimately be popular among your friends.

So this program is really just a way to make it easier to see what is popular right now. We’ve made margins to make it easy to get an overview. With this program we hope that you want to add the page to your bookmarks, so that you are always close to be updated, without having to go directly to giphy and bother with advertisements and a non-intuitive webpage. 

*(individual)Can you describe and reflect your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data? How much do you understand this provided data? How do platform providers sort the data and give you the selected data?*

Our method for acquiring the necessary data was very easy. We used a function that Giphy provides to not only get the gifs we wanted but also the most popular at the time og querying them. This method lets Giphy handle most of the processing behind handling the gifs and even catagorizing them. So we can just enjoy displaying them in our own program. But because its this easy you dont really get the feeling of working with API's. How you must explore large files to access different kind of content. 

*(individual)Try to formulate a question in relation to web APIs or querying processes that you want to investigate further when you have more time.*

**How do you work with JSON to access content?**
