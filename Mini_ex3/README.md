## Throbber fun or...?
This weeks exercise has been focused on temporality.

Throbbers and loading animations is ironically a bigger part than ever, on our blazing fast websites. Like an ex it turns up in the most unfortunate of times and make the tiniest of hairs raise from our arms. What is wrong? Processes? Internet traffic? Errors? The current trend is to never let you know, placehold it with cute animations and hope that you will stick along for another load.

In the late night hours the letters of 'Buffering' blends together and shows us what we really feel like we're doing: 'Suffering'. The throbbers is a replacement of loading bars and actually telling you what is going on. This makes the waiting feel timeless and distorted. I hope this will die out and bring back the transparency from older more simpler times of software and programs.

## The short development
I wanted to do some critical design on this topic. Mock or make fun of the idea behind throbbers. I wanted to combine a typical throbber design with something new. Maybe something that would reflect the feeling of waiting for an unknown amount of time. I started by making the throbber you see now and wanted to go on from there. But as I sat there and let the inspiration flow and tried to come up with some critique about the throbber, my program just sat there and spun around. Endlessly.

Maybe the best critique about throbbers is the throbbers themselves? Note that its not the act of waiting thats the problem, but the idea of timelessness in the throbbers animation. Like an 80's casino it removes all signs of progress and provides us only the smallest of timelines. The companies then hope that we forget the reference point and can no longer tell if 10, 20 or 30 seconds have gone by.

I wanted to devote the time of my programs users to the self-reflection on why we're waiting. What are we waiting for? Should we keep waiting? I call this:

## The learning experience
This weeks exercise I have used more of my time planning than executing. While it was fun, I felt less productive. There is a lot of things in this code that I dont like personally and more time could've been used on perfecting this small animation.
Things I would've changed:
- Two of the cyan colors look too much the same in my opinion.
- It's coded so the all circles have the same reference point(translate). The distance could've been more consistant if every circle had their own reference point. Other solutions could also be using better match to calculate the speed for every odd circle so all match or using distance to the translate point(Much like placing them on the periphery of a circle)
- Adding more circles
