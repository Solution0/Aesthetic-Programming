## Its listening
This weeks theme was data capturing, a very sensitive subject in modern days. In this exercise we should create a program that in some way captures data and uses it. This could be mousetracking, inputs, keyboard, variables and so on..


### Data capturing 
Data capturing is everywhere. Dictating how we surf the internet, what content we should see and when to tell us what it knows. Data capturing is not just a bad thing, it makes us able to interact with things. The mouse, keyboard, microphones and webcams are all a part of this and without the tracking of theese inputs the computer would not be more useful than a pictureframe.

BUT.. Data capturing can also be capitalized and become profitable. Most notably by using cookies.

But these are not the delicious kind, these is if each chocolate chip was replaced by a raisin. Leaving us with only anger and a bad taste in our mouth. Because the amount of information, not to mention the use of it, is sometimes outrageous. Our own desire to browse a free and open internet often gets narrowed by 'personalized' content. But even worse is your spending habits and income gets manipulated in different ways. The most wellknown and controversial of theese comes from webshops selling airplane tickets and hotel stays. 

By knowing what content you're looking at they can change the price to give you a false sense of popularity in theese tickets. This does not only pressure you to buy the ticket, but also pay way too much for it. Even down to your geografical location can be used against you. Living in Denmark with a high average wage you can often be charged more than someone in Italy for the same seat. While this can be argued as fair given the extra income, it is nonetheless not the neutrality that the internet is known for.

### My program
As a response to this use of data capture I have made a exaggerated visualization of this. The program gives you the opportunity to buy a airplane ticket from Billund to London. But as you click on it, you are confronted by a pop-up window. This window ask you, how much you want to go on this vacation. Your price will then change accordingly to how much you want to go, effectively making you pay more, right before your eyes. Scandalous.
