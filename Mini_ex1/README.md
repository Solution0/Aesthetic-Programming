!#Frustration.io
!This is my first p5.js coding experience. 
!The old saying goes that the more you click, the faster it load. But sometimes it loads so fast that the program crashes. I wanted to capture this feeling of frustration in my first program on p5.js.
!It's made in honor of Club Penguin. A fantastic chatroom/website that closed down 30/3-2017.


!#The Experience
!This coding involved a lot of searching on both on Google and on the p5.js references. A thing that i expected when i dove into this programming language. I have some experience in Java, Unity and C++ and was expecting the frustration i would have myself, when compiling this program. During the time of programming i have scrapped plenty of code and ideas before settling on this one, some more serious than others. 

!It differed a lot from both reading and writing 'normal' texts. Where i normally would have a more straightforward process i divided my idea into 'Need', 'want' and 'nice to have'. This helped me a lot in structuring what i wanted to code and made simple problems easier to solve. This way of coding also made it easier to go back to older state in which the program worked, if I ever struck a problem. 

!I wanted to explore and learn conditions in this program, a thing that i finder rather hard. Also i wanted to make something dynamic and interactive.
!Next time I would like to dive deeper into variables and conditions. Maybe mousetracking.
