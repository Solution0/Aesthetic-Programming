For this exercise we were given the task to draw a flowchart around our most technically complex mini exercise to date. For this I have chosen my mini exercise #6. While its not the exercise with the longest code, it did include some complex and stacked 'if'-statements.

What was really difficult in creating this flowchart was the differentiation between Lifeform 1 and 2. This was done, same as in the code, with the variables i and j. This bridges the technical to it's presentation about it. And while it was not difficult per say I realised the lack of an 'end' in the program. It would theoretically run forever if given the opportunity. 

I could have gone deeper into what it means to 'Create a Lifeform' or what it means to touch. But I've choosen not to do this to make it more read- and suitable for presentation.
